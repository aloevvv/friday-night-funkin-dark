# Friday Night Funkin': Dark
A fangame for FNF, still in progress, will be told as a visual novel rather than a rythm game

Plot: Angering a family of demons wasn’t his goal when Pico signed up for this assasination job, but when he sleeps with his ex & target after plenty of bad decisions, things start falling apart. He’s fucked up his job, Boyfriend’s fucked up his relationship with Girlfriend, and now, with dire consequences coming their way, Pico has to team up with the asshole who got him into this mess.
